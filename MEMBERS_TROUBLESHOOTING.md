### Issue: "Members not displaying"

**Check 1: Is MongoDB Running?**
```powershell
# Make sure MongoDB is running on your system
```

**Check 2: Is Database Seeded?**
```powershell
cd d:\LACPA\Lacpa\Backend

# Seed individual members
node scripts/seed_individuals.js

# Seed firms
node scripts/seed_firms.js
```

**Check 3: Check Database Connection**
```
# In your .env file, verify:
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
MONGO_DATABASE=lacpa
```

### Issue: "Template Errors" or "Blank Page"

**Check Browser Console**
1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Look for errors (red text)
4. Check "Network" tab for failed requests

**Common Console Errors:**
- **HTMX not loaded**: Make sure HTMX script is in your index.html
- **CORS errors**: Check server allows CORS
- **404 on assets**: Check static file paths

### Issue: "Pagination Not Working"

**Verify Data Exists:**
```powershell
# Check how many members were inserted
# Should show: "Successfully inserted 50 individual members"
node scripts/seed_individuals.js
```

**Check Template Variables:**
The handler should pass these to the template:
- `.Members` - Array of member objects
- `.CurrentPage` - Current page number  
- `.TotalPages` - Total number of pages
- `.PageSize` - Items per page (default: 12)
- `.TotalCount` - Total number of members
